Supported Input Devices
------------------------

Isaac Teleop provides a standardized interface for teleoperation devices, removing the need for
custom device integrations and ongoing maintenance. It supports multiple XR headsets and tracking
peripherals. Each device provides different input modes, which determine which retargeters and
control schemes are available. Easily extend support for additional devices through a plugin system;
see :ref:`device-interface-device-plugin` for details.

In addition to the fully integrated XR headsets, Isaac Teleop also supports standalone input
devices. Those devices are typically directly connected to the workstation where the Isaac Teleop
session is running via USB or Bluetooth. See :ref:`device-interface-device-plugin` for more details.

Targeted Robotics Embodiments
-----------------------------

- Retarget the standardized device outputs to different embodiments.
- `Reference retargeter implementations <https://github.com/NVIDIA/IsaacTeleop/tree/main/src/retargeters/>`_,
  including popular embodiments such as Unitree G1.
- `Retargeter tuning UI <https://github.com/NVIDIA/IsaacTeleop/tree/main/src/core/retargeting_engine_ui/python>`_ to facilitate
  live retargeter tuning.

Social Links
------------

Join the Isaac Teleop community to ask questions, share your work, and stay up to date.

Discord (NVIDIA official)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Isaac Teleop has a dedicated ``isaac-teleop`` channel in the official NVIDIA Omniverse
Discord server. Joining takes two steps:

#. **Join the server.** Open the `NVIDIA Omniverse Discord invite`_ and accept it to become a
   member of the NVIDIA Omniverse Discord server.
#. **Open the channel.** Once you are a member of the server, go to the
   `#isaac-teleop channel`_ to reach the team and the community. (The channel link only works
   after you have joined the server in step 1.)

WeChat (微信) group (community-run)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A community-driven WeChat group is also available. Scan the QR code below from **within the
WeChat app** (Discover → Scan) to join. Scanning with your phone's built-in camera app will
**not** work.

   **Figure:** Scan from within the WeChat app (not the camera app) to join the community WeChat group

.. note::

   This WeChat group is created and maintained by community members. It is **not** an official
   NVIDIA channel. The NVIDIA team does not participate in group operations, but does monitor the
   group and answer questions when possible.

   More than one community chat group may exist, and we may list additional groups here as we
   become aware of them. That said, NVIDIA encourages the community to organically converge on a
   single chat group, so that discussions stay consolidated in one place.
